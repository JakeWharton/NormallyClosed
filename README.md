# Garage Pie

Open and close your garage door with a Raspberry Pi.

Sometimes I forget to close my garage door when I leave the house.
Sometimes I need to let someone into my house when I am not home.
This allows me to do both of those things in a low-complexity way.
Or, at least, in a way with complexity that I'm comfortable with.

**Pros**

- Low cost. Raspberry Pis are ubiquitous and low-cost. I had two lying around. The required HATs are
  cheap (or you could just solder a relay directly), cases are cheap, and wire is cheap.
- No ecosystem. The boards connect over regular Wi-Fi or ethernet and expose a simple HTTP
  interface. You can expose them to the internet however you want, or don't. You can expose them to
  automation tooling (like Home Assistant), or don't.

**Cons**

- Not turnkey. Building the hardware and setting up the software is not hard, but it is still a
  solution that involves more setup than something like an off-the-shelf device.
- No polish. Will not pass the Significant-Other Barâ„¢ out-of-the-box.


## Hardware

You will need to obtain three main components:
- Raspberry Pi computer
- One 24V relay per door (usually from a HAT)
- Wall- or ceiling-mountable case

### Raspberry Pi Zero

The Raspberry Pi Zero is the ideal board given its price, that the software CPU/RAM requirements
are low, and that it will likely be mounted to the ceiling. Ensure you get the Zero W for a board
that includes a Wi-Fi chip (or the Zero WH).

#### Suggested Cases

- [UniPiCase Zero (Tall)](https://www.unipicase.com/products/unipicase-zero/)

  A dedicated hole will need drilled through the case near the terminals to accommodate the garage
  door wire.

### Raspberry Pi 3/4

The full-size Raspberry Pi boards are more than capable (if not overkill). Generally they would
only be preferred if you already had one or if you need more than 2 relays to control more than 2
doors (without otherwise building a custom relay board).

#### Suggested Relay HATs

#### Suggested Case
- [LoveRPI Active Cooling Media Center PC Case](https://www.loverpi.com/products/loverpi-active-cooling-media-center-pc-case)

  You will have to remove the fan, the fan mounting standoffs, and the coupling standoff to fit the
  board with a HAT. Additionally, if your HAT is secured to the Pi with a standoff and screws
  beneath the board you will have to shave down the plastic board standoffs ~1mm to accommodate the
  screw heads. The garage door wire will have to be passed through the fan slits, or a dedicated
  hole will need drilled near the terminals.

## FAQ

### Why not OpenGarage?

- I already had a camera in the garage and do not need detection.
- I did not like how it exposed itself through the internet.
- I had two Raspberry Pi 3b boards lying around and paternity leave time.

### Why not Z-Wave?

- I did not want to stand up an ecosystem for two simple toggles.
- I had two Raspberry Pi 3b boards lying around and paternity leave time.

### Why not Sonoff?

- I found out about it at the end of building this.
- I had two Raspberry Pi 3b boards lying around and paternity leave time.

### Why not [some other product]?

- I probably didn't know it existed.
- I had two Raspberry Pi 3b boards lying around and paternity leave time.
